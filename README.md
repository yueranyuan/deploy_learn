### Deploy Learn

This is a library for simplifying parameter search for machine learning. The library is designed to be as flexible as possible. It is designed to be a set of tools rather than a framework.

There are 4 key goals for this module
 * Be Flexible: make as few assumptions as possible about the program to be optimized.
 * Be Modular: this is not a framework, but it can be used as one. The individual components (deployment, logging, analysis) should work on their own.
 * Show Data: we don't hide the analysis from the user. We show the effect that the parameters have across all runs and perform significance tests.

#### How to use?

This information will be added soon. For now, if you find this project and are interested in trying it just post an issue on the repo and I will upload some instructions.
